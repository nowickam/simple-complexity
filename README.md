# simple-complexity

Three prints inspired by malachite formation patterns and slime mold - under the umbrella term of complexity emerging from elementary interactions between cells and elements.

Every medium carries an imperfection specific to the material or technique used in the process of production. What is the imperfection of a computer? In this work, it was the human programmer. In its precise execution of every command, the human becomes the source of desirable and undesirable phenomena.

This work explores the organic interactions of singular-cell organisms and formation patterns of minerals with the contribution of the inorganic code bugs. It was a part of the Introduction to Creative Coding course exhibition at the Aalto University.
